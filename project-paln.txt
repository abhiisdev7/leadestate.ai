# Project: AI Automated Campaign Real Estate CRM

## Overview

Build an AI-powered real estate CRM focused on email campaigns. The system handles both outbound campaigns and inbound leads, with AI-generated responses in the loop.

---

## Flow

### 1. Contacts in CRM

- We maintain a set of contacts in the CRM.
- We send campaigns to selected contacts, OR contacts reach us first via email.

### 2. Outbound Campaigns

- When we send a campaign to selected contacts, we add a custom header to each email.
- Example: `X-Campaign: 1111`
- This header lets us identify our own sent emails when reading them back via IMAP.
- We read these emails and insert them into the database.

### 3. Inbound Lead Handling

- An inbound job runs every minute to check for new emails.
- If we receive a lead (inbound email), we automatically send an AI-generated response based on the customer's message.

### 4. Conversation Loop

- The flow continues: the customer may reply asking for available properties, etc.
- We have properties in our CRM and can send them.
- The customer may reply again—the conversation continues.
- After 4–5 exchanges, we ask to schedule a call—if the customer is still engaged.
- (We may schedule a call earlier if the customer's replies indicate readiness.)

### 5. AI in the Loop

- AI generates contextual responses throughout the conversation.
- The system handles qualification, property suggestions, and call scheduling.

## 6. AI Handling of Inbound Emails
- We also receive inbound emails from customers who are interested in selling their properties (for example, those requesting information about listing a property).
- The system must classify each inbound email (buyer lead, seller lead, general inquiry, spam, etc.).
- Email threads should be organized and saved correctly, associating all messages within a conversation for each lead.

## Tech Stack
